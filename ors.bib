abstract = {The paper presents a detailed survey of results concerning the main decision problems of group theory and semigroup theory, including the word problem, the isomorphism problem, recognition problems, and other algorithmic questions related to them. The well-known theorems of Markov-Post, P. S. Novikov, Adian-Rabin, Higman, Magnus, and Lyndon are given with complete proofs. As a rule, the proofs presented in this survey are substantially simpler than those given in the original papers. For the sake of completeness, we first prove the insolubility of the halting problem for Turing machines, on which the insolubility of the word problem for semigroups is based. Specific attention is also paid to the simplest examples of semigroups with insoluble word problem. We give a detailed proof of the significant result of Lyndon that, in the class of groups presented by a system of defining relations for which the maximum mutual overlapping of any two relators is strictly less than one fifth of their lengths, the word problem is soluble, while insoluble word problems can occur when non-strict inequality is allowed. A proof of the corresponding result for finitely presented semigroups is also given, when the corresponding fraction is one half.},

abstract = {It is known that the word problemfor one-relator groups and for one-relator monoids of the form Mon  A || w =1  is decidable. However, the question of decidability of the word problem for general one-relation monoids of the form M = Mon  A || u = v  where u and v are arbitrary (positive) words in A remains open. The present paper is concerned with one-relator inverse monoids with a presentation of the form M =Inv  A || w =1  where w is some word in A ∪ A − 1 . We show that a positive solution to the word problemfor such monoids for all reduced words w would imply a positive solution to the word problem for all one-relation monoids. We prove a conjecture of Margolis, Meakin and Stephen by showing that every inverse monoid of the form M =Inv  A || w =1  , where w is cyclically reduced, must be E -unitary. As a consequence the word problem for such an inverse monoid is reduced to the membership problem for the submonoid of the corresponding one-relator group G =Gp  A || w =1  generated by the pre:xes of the cyclically reduced word w . This enables us to solve the word problemfor inverse monoids of this type in certain cases.},

Thue's 1914 paper is mainly famous for proving an early example of an undecidable problem, cited prominently by Post. However, Post's paper principally makes use of the definition of Thue systems, described on the first two pages of Thue's paper, and does not depend on the more specific results in the remainder of Thue's paper. A closer study of the remaining parts of that paper highlight a number of important themes in the history of computing: the transition from algebra to formal language theory, the analysis of the "computational power" (in a pre-1936 sense) of rules, and the development of algorithms to generate rule-sets.},

abstract = {In this thesis we consider in detail the following two fundamental problems for semigroup presentations: 1. Given a semigroup find a presentation defining it. 2. Given a presentation describe the semigroup defined by it. We also establish two links between these two approaches: semigroup constructions and computational methods. After an introduction to semigroup presentations in Chapter 3, in Chapters 4 and 5 we consider the first of the two approaches. The semigroups we examine in these two chapters include completely 0-simple semigroups, transformation semigroups, matrix semigroups and various endomorphism semigroups. In Chapter 6 we find presentations for the following semi group constructions: wreath product, Bruck-Reilly extension, Schiitzenberger product, strong semilattices of monoids, Rees matrix semigroups, ideal extensions and subsemigroups. We investigate in more detail presentations for subsemigroups in Chapters 7 and 10, where we prove a number of Reidemeister-Schreier type results for semigroups. In Chapter 9 we examine the connection between the semi group and the group defined by the same presentation. The general results from Chapters 6, 7, 9 and 10 are applied in Chapters 8, 11, 12 and 13 to subsemigroups of free semigroups, Fibonacci semigroups, semigroups defined by Coxeter type presentations and one relator products of cyclic groups. Finally, in Chapter 14 we describe the Todd-Coxeter enumeration procedure and introduce three modifications of this procedure.},

After showing that the different concepts of conjugacy become identical in special monoids, which gives an affirmative answer to an open problem in [7], we prove that the conjugacy problem is decidable for some restricted classes of special monoids. ?? 1991.},
