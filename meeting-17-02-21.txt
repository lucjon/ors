Broader notes from meeting with NR, 21/02/17.

* Unindent proofs
* Generally appropriate layout and level of detail in first two sections
* Mention the implementation of Zhang's algorithm
	- Perhaps perform some quantitative analysis of `probabilities' that
	  picking random words gives groups, trivial monoids or `interesting'
	  examples
	- Depending on the patterns, these might be easy to prove
* Look at the structure theorem for the submonoid of right units
	- Free product of group of units (for which we now have a presentation) and
	  a free semigroup
* Investigate the algorithm in the context of inverse monoids
	- Special inverse monoid WP iff semigroup WP
	- Zhang's algorithm produces a generating set for the group of units of the
	  inverse monoid
		= Prop 4.11 in Ivanov, Margolis, Meakin; NR thinks him and Bob Grey
		  might have the result without cyclically reduced hypothesis
	- Do we reduce to the group of units in the same/similar way?
		= If so, can discuss pretty much the same theory with a big unproved
		  bit
