*** AGENDA FOR MEETING WITH NIK

	1.	Questions about the papers
		Check that the broad ideas (reducing to group of units, complete
		rewriting systems give algorithms to decide WP, etc.) are correct.

		- A Short Proof...
			- Highlighted section about it being a group (p. 2) and why exactly
			  $w$ is expressible as a product of factors in $E(M)$.
		
		- Rewriting methods for special monoids
			- ??

	2.	Propose some papers to look over next
		- Mention not being able to find the English translation of Adian's
		  original paper
		- Extending semigp/monoid results
			- reductions, like Adian's to uvw
		- Looking at related results (not just WP) i.e. other
			- divisibility/other decision problems
			- complexity of division problems
		  problems/Freiheitssatz/etc.
		- Looking at Magnus' group result
		- Other results for rewriting systems in general?

		- Ask him for suggestions on papers or directions
	
	3.	Questions about the form of the dissertation
		- Target audience
		- Background material required
		- Format of background material
		- Pick a few results from the literature and prove them? Change proofs?
		  Broader survey?
			* What will the bulk of the written document look like?
